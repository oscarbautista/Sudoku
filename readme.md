The sudoku.js file contains all the methods of the Sudoku API needed for building and modifying sudoku puzzles.

To demonstrate how it can be implemented, I have created an example using Node.js. In order to run the server, node.js, express, and pug must be installed. 

Once installed run using the command: 

node index.js

After running it, it will be on localhost:3000 and the webpage will display the current sudoku board. All the values can be modified by going into the index.js file. If the values are valid after being changed, they will change on the webpage, otherwise, they will remain unchanged.
